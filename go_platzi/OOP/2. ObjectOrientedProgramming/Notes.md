# Go OOP

## Clases

They define the properties of an object, we can think of them as a sort of a blueprint.

The equivalent of a class in go is a struct.

## Methods

They use receiver functions. In this type of function the receiver plays the part of the self or this. The use case of this types of functions doesn't seem to be limited to methods, but in this case we're using it.

## constructors

This are used to give initial values to an object when declaring it.
